# Classification of Fresh and Rotten Fruits using NASNetMobile

Bangkit Final Project of Group JKT2B

To reproduce it, opening our notebook [improvement_NASNetMobile.ipynb](https://github.com/fadheladlansyah/fruits-fresh-and-rotten/blob/master/improvement_NASNetMobile.ipynb)
 and run all the cells inside Google Colabs

## Description 
This project aims to classify fresh or rotten fruits using NASNetMobile. 

## Dataset 
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification) consist of 13599 photos for three kinds of  fruits: apples, oranges, bananas. Each fruit has 2 category, which is fresh and rotten. There are 6 levels:
1. Fresh Apple
2. Fresh Banana
3. Fresh Orange
4. Rotten Apple
5. Rotten Banana
6. Rotten Orange

## Depedencies

- Tensorflow 2.2.0
- Matplotlib 3.2.1
- Numpy 1.18.4
- ImageCV 4.1.2

## Result
The NASNetMobile model has good accuracy (~98%) while testing on a random sample image from Google and also has a smaller size file (31 mb) than other models.
